    <h4>Among all of these cars bugatti has the top speed record of 260Km/hr.It is the fastest-accelerating car of the Chiron range with a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) of 2.3 seconds. 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) takes 5.5 seconds and 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) takes 12.4 seconds. It has a top speed of 380 km/h (236 mphOn 3 March 2020, Bugatti introduced the Chiron Pur Sport, a handling-focused model limited to 60 units. The tachometer has an additional 200 rpm, increasing the redline to 6,900 rpm. 80 per cent of the transmission has been revised for a 15 per cent closer gear-ratio spread benefiting the power band. The Pur Sport is 50 kg (110 lb) lighter than the standard Chiron due to a lightweight 3D printed titanium exhaust, a fixed rear spoiler and extensive use of Alcantara, anodised aluminium and titanium on the interior. The wheels have special spokes called "aero blades" which are designed to channel turbulent air near the wheel down the side of the vehicle to the rear diffuser. The tyres are Michelin Sport Cup 2R increasing lateral grip by 10 per cent, and were co-developed with Michelin. To improve handling, the springs were made 65 per cent stiffer at the front and 33 per cent at the rear, aided by revised damper tuning and wheel camber along with additional front and rear carbon-fibre anti-roll bars and a new Sport+ drive mode. Production of the Pur Sport is expected to start in late 2020.[46][47] The first car was delivered to the owner in United States in January 2021.[48] The 30th Chiron Pur Sport has been delivered to its owner on 1 December 2022, marking the production reaches the halfway point.[49]). <h4>
